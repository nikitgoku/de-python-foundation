# Data Engineering: Python Foundations

A minimal starter repository for learning and building Python fundamentals used in data engineering workflows. This project involves examples, exercises, and templates for best practices in coding, testing, and packaging.

## Contents

Each and every day some topics will be covered and the basics and exercise related to them will be committed in the specific days folder. For example day1 contains Python foundations along with some mini exercises.

## Getting started

Prerequisites (just for my reference):
- Python 3.10+
- pip

Quick start:
1. Clone the repo
   git clone [<repo-url>](https://github.com/nikitgoku/de-python-foundation.git)
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
